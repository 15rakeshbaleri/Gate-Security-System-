## üîß Modules & Features

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Face Recognition (For Walk-in Visitors)
- A camera scans the visitor‚Äôs face.
- If the person is recognized, entry is recorded.
- If unrecognized, the AI assistant collects visitor details.

‚úÖ **Why is this useful?**
- Tracks every entry automatically.
- Reduces manual work for security personnel.
- Eliminates paper-based visitor logs.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Car Plate Detection (For Visitors with Vehicles)
- Captures the license plate using a camera.
- Checks the database for registered vehicles.
- Opens the gate automatically for recognized vehicles.
- Activates AI Voice Assistant if the vehicle is unregistered.

‚úÖ **Why is this useful?**
- Eliminates the need for manual vehicle checks.
- Provides quick, automated access for employees.
- Maintains a digital log of all vehicle entries.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ AI Voice Assistant (For New Visitors)
- If a visitor is neither recognized by face nor vehicle, the AI assistant asks for their **name, phone number, and purpose of visit**.
- The visitor responds verbally, and the system automatically fills out the form.
- The details are saved for future visits.

‚úÖ **Why is this useful?**
- Simplifies visitor registration with voice input.
- Reduces manual data entry.
- Enhances security with a digital visitor log.

### üìä Data Logging & Security Integration
- Every visitor (recognized or new) is **logged in the database**.
- Security personnel can review logs anytime for **monitoring and reporting**.

‚úÖ **Why is this useful?**
- Provides a **secure** and **centralized** visitor database.
- Reduces the risk of unauthorized entry.
- Improves **tracking** and **security audits**.
